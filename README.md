# Miscellaneous Ruby code

by Paul Thompson - nossidge@gmail.com

This is just a repository of code that I want to keep, but not
anywhere final. Maybe I'm still working on it, or maybe it's
not quite substantial enough to deserve its own repo or gem.

All of this is liable to be removed/changed without notice.
You probably shouldn't examine this repo too closely, it's
really just for me.
